This application was developed using Visual Studio (2010) and C#. In order to test the application, open the project file using Visual Studio. Select run without debugging. When prompted for a thread number enter the amount of threads for travel agencies you would like to test (i.e. 4) then press enter. The application should run and display when price cuts occur and when orders are sent and received. After all the orders have completed, you will be prompted to display a list of orders and then prompted again to display the processing times of the threads.
